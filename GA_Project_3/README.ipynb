We other word might be seasonal- \"surge\"s seem to be a good trend which our drivers enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our enquiry into the general sentiments towards the two companies, both of us share the communities' concern towards time-related words, while our community can be differentiated from DoorDash's by the word \"good\". We will take note of this positive trend.\n",
