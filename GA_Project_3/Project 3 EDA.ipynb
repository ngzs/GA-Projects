    "We are a team of analysts from Uber Eats, attempting to find out if there is brand differentiation between our platform and Door Dash, and what are the general trends in vernacular that our Uber Eats community, both drivers and users, are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "These will seek to inform our marketing team about how we can bring out brand forward, and also our platform/product management team on how we can improve our services.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using subreddit posts to find out what words differentiate us from our competitor, and which words are most commonly used amongst the communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore various models to find out which is the most accurate, as being able to get the highest accuracy of identifying our competitor and our own will allow us to utilise the differentiating words well (these words are able to tell us and DoorDash apart).\n",
    "\n",
    "Caveats: Throughout this document, there would be references to DD and UE, which are the acronyms for DoorDash and Uber Eats respectively. This will be even more commonly used when labelling our data."

      "Raise Base Pay! Sign My Petition!Hi guys! My name is Madison and I have been dashing for a little over 2 years. When I first started, base pay used to be much higher, but they lowered it sometime last year. Now with the rising inflation and skyrocketing gas prices, I am no longer really making enough to survive. I am hoping to do something to change that. If you're like me, you are beyond disappointed in doordash for not raising their base pay to match inflation. You are also probably just as disappointed in the letdown that is this new \"gas comp\" plan. 5$ for 100 miles...really. I feel that base pay should be raised by $1.50 per delivery at a base mile distance of 6 miles, and I feel this base pay should be raised by .25 per mile past the 6-mile point. For example, if base pay were raised to $3.50 per delivery (base pay is $2 in my area), and the mileage was 10 miles, base pay should now be $5.50. I also feel that doordash should provide higher base pays on apparent no-tips to compensate for the risk factor of taking orders with no pre-dash electronic tip. I know this may not due much, but I am frustrated and willing to try anything! Please sign!  [https://chng.it/GZLCrZ8Z](https://chng.it/GZLCrZ8Z)\n",

      "Fuel Surcharge Explained. Every facet of the logistics industry uses them except the On-Demand Companies, and it needs to stopWhat is a national fuel surcharge? Fuel surcharge meaning\n",
      "\n",
      "A national fuel surcharge is an extra fee that trucking companies (or third parties) charge to cover the fluctuating cost of fuel. It is calculated as a percentage of the base rate and is usually added to a shipper’s freight bill to cover the cost of operations. The fuel surcharge depends on the average fuel price and can be different for each shipper or industry, depending on the fuel cost to revenue ratio. It covers additional fuel costs and keeps carriers profitable, even when the cost of fuel rises.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is a fuel surcharge calculated?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no uniform way of calculating fuel taxes as companies use their own formula. Most carriers have information on how they determine the fuel overcharge on their website. For example, UPS uses an index-based surcharge that is adjusted monthly and is based on the National U.S. Average On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Current national average fuel surcharge rate  \n",
      "\n",
      "The relevant national fuel average can be tracked on the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) website. Currently, the UPS average fuel surcharge is 8% for ground and 6.75% for domestic air.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to calculate fuel surcharge? National fuel surcharge calculation formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "Threshold fuel price: If fuel costs more than the base price, the surcharge will be applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Base fuel mileage: Usually 5-7 miles per gallon. The average 18-wheeler gets about 6.00 mpg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current fuel price fluctuation: The U.S. Department of Energy serves as a source for this information. National and regional average prices are published weekly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average price, minus the agreed base fuel price, is divided by miles per gallon equates to the surcharge rate. For example, suppose the current price of fuel is $2.50 per gallon, fuel mileage is 6 mpg and the base fuel price is $1.20.\n",
      "\n",
      "$2.50 – $1.20 = $1.30\n",
      "\n",
      "$1.30/6 = $0.22\n",
      "\n",
      "To get the total fuel surcharge amount per particular shipment, the surcharge rate should be multiplied by miles are driven:\n",
      "$0.22*600 = $132\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, if a load travels 600 miles, the shipper can expect to pay a $132 fuel tax amount. Another, less popular method of calculating is based on a percentage from load price. For example, if a surcharge is at 20%, then a $500 load would have a surcharge of $100.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are there any regulations on a national fuel surcharge?\n",
      "\n",
      "No federal administration regulates a fuel surcharge policy.  Each shipper and carrier individually negotiate and set the policy in contracts. There is a vast space for fraud – there are no legal requirements to control passing collected fuel taxes from a shipper to a person who actually pays for fuel for the shipper’s load. The carrier may have stated a flat surcharge for their drivers, but much higher surcharge prices for shippers – so they could pocket the difference. Shippers should know that surcharge money will actually be passed to drivers.\n",

Usually when I'm in a car and I get these kinds of orders with a low item count they are small grocery or house-hold items. Long story short everything starts to go wrong. Turns out I got the order because of a glitch and for some reason employees are not doing what they are supposed to do even though they can still see all of the order information as well as driver details. I suspect their log became backed up causing the pickup area to become flooded with drivers, so they probably decided to have dashers come in instead. From what I could tell this only backed up everything up even more because all of the pickup spots were filled with empty cars and dashers who are told to come in after they finally find a spot as well as people picking up their personal orders.\n",

      "\n",
      "I've noticed from reading on this board that a lot of people have saved quick snippets of text in their Notes App to be able to quickly text their customer or DoorDash Support. While this works, the process could be both faster and easier. There is a free App available for iOS called \"WordBoard\". This App adds a secondary keyboard to your iPhone that can contain custom buttons. When you click one of your buttons, it inputs a block of text that you've setup in advance. This is a very quick and easy way to setup responses that you'll use often. It also avoids the need to run multiple Apps that you have to copy/paste from. Once you've installed the App, setup your buttons and responses in WordBoard's settings (they let you create up to 6 responses for free, more if you get premium). Then when you need to message support or a customer, just tap the globe icon in the bottom left corner of your keyboard on your iPhone. This will bring up your WordBoard buttons and you just tap the one that has the message that you want to send. It fills it all instantly and then you can tap the globe again to switch back to your normal iPhone keyboard. It saves a ton of time and is as easy as it gets. Figured I'd share!  \n",

      "Independent contractors are not considered “employees” under the Fair Labor Standards Act and therefore are not covered by its wage and hour provisions.  Generally, an independent contractor’s wages are set pursuant to his or her contract with the employer. These contracts often establish a deadline for completion of the work but do not contain set hours where the contractor is required to work on the employer’s job site.  This flexibility is one of the hallmarks of an independent contractor relationship.*\n",

      "**The Right to Organize**\n",
      "\n",
      "*As an independent contractor, the terms and conditions of the work you perform are set out in a contract between you and the employer.  Even though you are not considered an “employee” under federal labor law, you may still join a union.   However, you should keep in mind that a unit of independent contractors is not subject to the same privileges and protections as a regular union bargaining unit.  For example, an employer is not under the same obligation to bargain with a union regarding contract terms for an independent contractor that it is to bargain over issues affecting its regular employees.  Also, an independent contractor who went on strike would not be protected from employer reprisals under the National Labor Relations Act.*         \n",
      "\n",
      "*Despite these limitations, joining a union as an independent contractor can yield lots of useful benefits and resources.  The local can help you secure health and equipment insurance, provide you with contract advice, and help you find and secure jobs.  The union can also fight for your legislative interests and provide educational programs.  One thriving example of an independent contractor unit is the Guild Freelancers, an active group of independent writers and journalists who have organized as a part of the larger Pacific Media Workers Guild, a CWA local.  Another great example is WashTech (the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers), a CWA local formed by Microsoft contract employees in 1998.*\n",

In the past 2 days for some reason, I've been running into a lot of problems with delivery people. I don't know if it's because I don't tip them enough during winter months or what (like $6), but they've been either messing up my order or not delivering them at all! 2 days ago when I last used DoorDash, I filmed a lady taking picture of her placing food down in my front door, and then took my order back into her car...\n",
      "\n",
      "I reported this to DoorDash support and they were hesitant to compensate me since there's no way for me to prove that the lady I filmed was the driver. This is because I never recorded whole thing. You see, when DoorDash told me she dropped off order, I was gonna head out. I live on 2nd floor of the building, so it's not like I can get down there immediately. I noticed her starting to leave, so it was at THAT POINT I took out my phone and started filming her walking back to her car with it and driving away. Because I never recorded the part of her actually dropping off the order, so DoorDash support kept insisting me that maybe it was someone else that took off with my order. Eventually they compensated me in credits so I can repurchase the order. However, I think this incident flagged my account, because it messed me up on my most recent order.\n",

      "On Sunday, I received a push notification from DoorDash for 50% off. If there was a promo code attached to the notification, I never saw it. Perhaps it was hidden in the minimized notification. I \"clicked through\" the notification, expecting to get the discount, but I didn't get it. I tried to get through to support before placing my order, but gave up after waiting for close to an hour, because my family was hungry. After dinner, I got back into the support queue, this time for only about 30 minutes. The person I spoke with escalated the call. The escalated support ensured me that I would be taken care of by a dedicated team that would get back to me within 24 hours. About a day later, I heard back from Escalated Support and was informed that they required a screenshot to honor the discount. I didn't have a screenshot of the initial notification which disappeared after I \"clicked through\" and I didn't have notification history turned on at the time. On Wednesday, I received another notification, reminding me to use my 50% discount. This time, I took a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/Lfj0IDa) and sent it to the support team. They responded with a request to send the uncropped screenshot, stating that the cropped version could have come from anywhere. Fortunately, I still had the uncropped version, so I sent that along. Their next response stated \"we cannot honor notifications of possible promotions.\" So that's where things are now. I'm waiting for a response to what's likely my last email before I give up. My main question is why the Christmas Bells is that promotion not automatically applied to my next order, or at least accessible somewhere else in my account. Their position that the discount is only available if I have the promo code, which at best was buried somewhere in a notification, is ludicrous.\n",

      "Tonight, as I was winding down and figured was at my last job of the night... the Little Ceasars was short-staffed and slammed with orders. A common issue at this location, but not nearly this bad. I almost unassigned when another (very ticked off) Dasher was a little mouthy about how she'd been waiting 40 minutes and had returned there twice already, but was going to 'dump' the order because she had three others to deliver. I did NOT want to wait around for 30-40 minutes for a $6.25 order. (Turns out it was one of those disguised tip jobs and ended up being much more). The exhausted looking manager looked at me and said, \"If she does unassign it and they offer it to you, will you take it? I'll give you a free pizza and soda, however you want it.\"   (That said, this manager knows me as I pick up there often.)  \n",

      "Sure enough, moments later, new order comes in and it's the one she dropped. They gave the pizza to  me less than a minute later and said the other one was at least 20 minutes out. So I updated my original customer to let her know they were busy, but that I'd wait for it and get it to her. Turns out this other order was, literally, across the street. Customer was thrilled. Frankly, I think he was super high and would have been happy no matter what. LOL  \n",

      "Went back and waited another 15 minutes, still letting my original customer know what was happening. I had told her I'd wait and I was going to honor that.

      "Ordered dd last night and my order was not correct and I’m looking for advice on what to do.I’m kind of at a loss for words and I’m not really sure how to resolve this issue as doordash customer support did literally nothing about this. Last night I really wanted frozen yogurt from a local yogurt shop, but I was not in the state of mind to be able to drive, so I used doordash. Anyways, on doordash the yogurt is advertised as their big cup for one flat rate of 14.95. I spent a lot of money just to get half filled yogurt cups that weren’t in the cup size that was advertised. I’ve gotten 14.00 dollars worth of yogurt in one cup before from this place and let me tell you this was not this. I contacted support and they offered me 18.50 in credit on a 50.00 dollar order. They said it could be put on my account as credit for another order or be refunded to my bank account. I don’t want to order from doordash again, so I said please refund me I don’t want the credit. The person helping me ignored that request and then gave me the credit anyways. I don’t know why they asked if they weren’t going to acknowledge my answer. I guess hindsight 20/20. I definitely would not have done this had I been sober. I feel really upset and taken advantage of because that’s a lot of money. Can anything be done? I don’t know if I should contact the store or doordash again. If anyone has any advice I’d appreciate it. Thanks. \n",

The gps takes me to a train station... the shop is on the opposite side (GREAT). I wind up trying to figure out how to take an extra 8 minutes to get to the proper location but i notice a stairway near the trainstation and walk underground to get to the store - the gentleman tells me the order will be ready in 15 minutes. I wait 22 minutes for this order... (feeling worse by the second). I get these 2 massive bags full of food. I had a chance to peruse the menu, every item is over $30 and appetizers are upwards of $16 so this lady spent at least $200 on a big dinner. I'm there wondering how the order was only $12.75... I walk back through the tunnel, get in my car, rush hour is starting now so its 22 minutes to the customer and from there at least 40 minutes back home cause of traffic (wonderful). This lady lives off-road, i go through winding roads up STEEP, STEEP hills to get to a pretty expensive home up on a high hilltop where you can see all of NJ and NY. She messages me to wait for a cash tip after drop off, and I call her twice and almost left without the tip.. but she showed up, and gave me $15. I was pretty okay, $15 isn't bad and she was very nice and smiled and made me feel less grumpy. I complete the order and look at the screen and oh... it was a hidden tip. She tipped me $40 on top of the $15 cash tip. $55 is the biggest tip I've ever made on doordash O.O\n",

It has been their policy to keep drivers on the phone for hours in disputes over missing payments of smaller amounts, under $20. To cause such severe mental distress that drivers have openly wept and require medical intervention; both in the privacy of their homes, and in their vehicle while logged in. The company is spending more money on CSR agents trained at keeping Dashers from disputed pay, than it would cost them to modify their policy to resolve disputes quickly and in the favor of the Dashers. \n",
      "\n",
      "The current policy exists to promote burnout of both drivers, and support staff in the call centers. Dasher support agents are forced; with threat of job loss, to defend this abusive policy if necessary for hours unending, at the expense of their mental stability. The policy exists to exhaust the Dashers, so that they stop asking for pay they are entitled too. As well as to exhaust the Support agents and create high turnover. The policy is so brutal that Dashers mostly give up on making back their lost funds in favor of continued mental stability, and to avoid causing unwarranted mental harm to the dasher support agents who are trapped by policy. It is time for this abusive policy to be changed.\n",

Dasher support doesn't and can't do jack about these merchants so if it gets bad enough I tell people take it to corporate complaint.  Well here's a story about another incident at another place I'll just say serves chicken.  I've been there dozens of times, the workers are nice, the manager like so many others is an ass.

I get to the window, hand my debit card, before I even get my card back the lady in the windows informs me they can't give me my order AND the dash order at the same time, said I'd have to circle back around and get back in line... I asked her why they didn't tell me that when I was at the speaker?...  some back and forth and she offers for me to speak to said manager.  He comes over and gives me some bullshit excuse and actually tells me it's DD policy drivers can't order whole doing a pickup.  I know FULL WELL that's bullshit.  I've been in there many times and ordered something small while the dash order was being made.  \n",

      "Referral Bonus ShenanigansNot sure how many of you have dealt with this, but if you do the \"invite a friend\" bonus, you absolutely must keep some records. DD is notorious for doing everything they can to make it difficult to claim bonuses. I have had a personal dasher friend and a family member who have used the recruit a friend in the past, and they both got screwed out of their bonuses with DD claiming the recruited friend \"did not follow the proper link.\" So, naturally whenever I do mine I always keep records to prove the sign up was done properly, and I take progress updates every day. \n",

      "Notice to all drivers entering gated communities: Uber/Uber Eats, Postmates, DoorDash, Grubhub, Amazon/Wholefoods, Shipt, Lyft, Veyo, etc...In the state of California (as with many other states) it is ILLEGAL for you to enter a private gated community without first being properly checked in by the gate attendant on duty! Most communities provide segregated lanes for residents (lanes that STRICTLY residents are able to utilize), and another lane(s) (for guests/delivery services); so please check/read posted signage before entering. As a security guard I often experience these types of services trying to enter ILLEGALLY, and causing damage to community equipment without having knowledge of the proper legalities for entering these types of communities. This is often not the fault of the driver directly, but rather a lack of education provided in DMV driver's manuals/driver-training schools regarding gated communities and the companies you are associated with not informing you properly. (Hopefully manual's and company notifications will be updated soon) Nonetheless private gated communities are considered PRIVATE PROPERTY; therefore, you DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENTER THEM WITHOUT EXPRESSED PERMISSION (not even county or law enforcement agencies can, so why would you be considered any different?). You will be held PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE for any damage you cause to any equipment/property with your vehicle when trying to enter them illegally. In addition, you could face FELONY trespass charges. Seems ridiculous, but yes charges could be pressed against you. Moreover, if you drive off without stopping after damaging community equipment/property, and your car information is obtained/reported you may also face charges for hit and run as the law requires you to stop. So, PLEASE REMEMBER the couple of dollars that you are being paid for a delivery IS NOT WORTH THE DAMAGES, NOR PERSONAL LIABILITIES YOU MAY BE HELD ACCOUNTIBLE FOR. The company's you are \"working\" for will not help you out, nor will they be held accountable as you are considered an independent contractor through their provided services. So, PLEASE STOP, say hello (share a story/couple of laughs), and take time to breathe from all your hard work you have been putting in. \n",

I live in a small town and when I signed up, it didn't give me an option to use a bike. From what I've seen, only certain towns/cities have the option for bikes. Where do I request that my town get bike deliveries? I'm not looking to make tons of money, just want to have something to do that pairs exercise with making some $\n",
       "1    Newbie question about stacked orders and problems with app gps or am I missing something?Hey everyone,\\n\\nJust want to say how helpful this subreddit has been! I’m new to DD and have had issues with stacked orders. For example, I accept a Dash for two orders, one from McDonald’s and the other at Wendys. It navigated me to McDonald’s and when I got there it wanted me to confirm I was at Wendys. \\n\\nI couldn’t figure out how to get out of it and click on the other one or what to do other than unassign the wendys order so I could get to the McDonald’s order. \\n\\nThis is the second time I’ve had this issue where it sends me to one place and wants me to confirm that I’m at the 2nd place. \\n\\nIm guessing it’s user error and I’m doing something wrong? Im just click accept and then following directions to wherever it leads me. Once I was able to unassign and confirm the other place I was able to talk to support and they said to just call if that happens and they Can unassign it on their end…but didn’t answer if that’s normal or why that would happen. I asked if there’s anything that addresses this in a beginners tutorial or something like that on their support site. \\n\\nOne more unrelated question, is there a negative impact to cancelling your Dash before the hour is over? If it wants me to work 11:30-12:30 and I end it at 12:15 does that affect a score?\\n\\nI apologize if these are basic questions! I appreciate y’all!\n",

I get a $4.00 offer from Pizza hut which I accepted only because I know this pizza hut closes at 10pm and its on the way home so fuck it ill get 2 bucks for cancelling it. Get to the pizza hut and sure enough, doors locked, lights off, they're closed up. So I mark it closed in the app and it doesn't even ask me to take a picture, just a quick confirm and im 2 bucks richer. As I walk back to my car the door opens and the employee goes \"For 'customer name\"?\" and without hesitating I go \"yup' and they hand me the order and close the door. Checked the receipt and this dude ordered an hour and a half ago, which is weird because I thought DD would up the pay at that point, but guess not. It was still pretty good, and it felt good knowing that one cheap asshole gets to starve tonight. \\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nto all the crybaby bootlickers who are gonna get personally offended on tonys behalf over this, I could care less, so save your strength for that Top Dasher grind and dont bother commenting</td>\n",

However in Mine, any type of place that sales ice cream, cakes, cookies etc always are no tips and all base pay. \\n\\nLike I did one that $8.50 for 5 miles. Took it because it put me in a area I was heading anyways. But when I get done I see it's all base pay lmao so fuck tony i guess. Every time I take a order for a place that sales desserts or sweets it's always base pay and 90% are double.\\n\\nIs it's just a Michigan thing?   \n",

I’d cancel his tip by calling support lol. Then “tip” tony by messaging him tips like “your company should take away customer ability to call support and take away tips” lol. Or tell him to make an 8 dollar min. Or some other useful tip.   \n",

       "355   Got some free Pizza Hut thanks to a non tipperIts 11:00pm and im ready to head home for the night. I get a $4.00 offer from Pizza hut which I accepted only because I know this pizza hut closes at 10pm and its on the way home so fuck it ill get 2 bucks for cancelling it. Get to the pizza hut and sure enough, doors locked, lights off, they're closed up. So I mark it closed in the app and it doesn't even ask me to take a picture, just a quick confirm and im 2 bucks richer. As I walk back to my car the door opens and the employee goes \"For 'customer name\"?\" and without hesitating I go \"yup' and they hand me the order and close the door. Checked the receipt and this dude ordered an hour and a half ago, which is weird because I thought DD would up the pay at that point, but guess not. It was still pretty good, and it felt good knowing that one cheap asshole gets to starve tonight. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nto all the crybaby bootlickers who are gonna get personally offended on tonys behalf over this, I could care less, so save your strength for that Top Dasher grind and dont bother commenting  \n",

However in Mine, any type of place that sales ice cream, cakes, cookies etc always are no tips and all base pay. \\n\\nLike I did one that $8.50 for 5 miles. Took it because it put me in a area I was heading anyways. But when I get done I see it's all base pay lmao so fuck tony i guess. Every time I take a order for a place that sales desserts or sweets it's always base pay and 90% are double.\\n\\nIs it's just a Michigan thing?  \n",

Or tell him to make an 8 dollar min. Or some other useful tip.  "

However, since tips make up roughly 50-75% of what you actually make, getting in more deliveries per hour increases tip amounts per hour. For instance, you could do about 2 deliveries of 8$ base fairs in an hour, but each one will get around 3-4$ average in tip; netting you 22-24$(not a bad hour). But, in that same hour, and with only 3$ base fair deliveries, you could do 4-5 deliveries in that hour, each with the same tip average; netting you 24-35$ (now that’s a moist hour right dhere!)\\n\\n3: darkness is better than sunshine\\n     -there’s a few advantages to delivering past the hour’s of 8 pm (if you don’t have a 7 year old’s bedtime) \\n-Restaurants after 8pm tend to have less costomers and so are more ready to prepare your delivery quicker.\\n-There are less cars on the road and so less traffic, making for quicker deliveries.\\n-Parking lots and spaces are more empty for closer and more easy parking.\\n-Many chain restaurants want you to use the drive through past 8 pm which can benefit drivers who don’t yet have a delivery bag\\n-I’ve noticed that past 8, the ratio of those sweet “leave at door” instructions appear as people are more likely in their jamyjams.

I’ve done 3 minutes at the buzzer, 4 minutes going up the elevator, 2 minutes walking down those god awful halls, 2 minutes back, 4 minutes down, and then 3 minute walk to my car parked far away cause the tall ones have underground private parking and are located on unparkable roads. Downtown has the best surges fo sho, but they also come with the most hellish of deliveries! Rich suburbs near shopping centers are la Uber crème. \\n\\n-Ghost mode\\n  - just a simple one, but I’ve found that if a costomer asks for “leave at door” and you are gone before they open their door, they usually give a “thumbs up” rating more often then if they saw me or interacted with me. Why? Idk, maybe I’m friteningly ugly. And so, after droping off the food, only post on the app that it’s been delivered once you are already in your car and about to leave, that way, costomer gets the ding that their food’s there, they open the door 5 seconds later and POOF, you’re already gone. They will be inpressed by your vanishing act and respect you having bolted off their precious property. \\n\\n\\nHope you put these to good use (except if you’re in Edmonton, cause that there town aint big enough fer the both uv us)</td>\n",

I’ve done 3 minutes at the buzzer, 4 minutes going up the elevator, 2 minutes walking down those god awful halls, 2 minutes back, 4 minutes down, and then 3 minute walk to my car parked far away cause the tall ones have underground private parking and are located on unparkable roads. Downtown has the best surges fo sho, but they also come with the most hellish of deliveries! Rich suburbs near shopping centers are la Uber crème. \\n\\n-Ghost mode\\n  - just a simple one, but I’ve found that if a costomer asks for “leave at door” and you are gone before they open their door, they usually give a “thumbs up” rating more often then if they saw me or interacted with me. Why? Idk, maybe I’m friteningly ugly. And so, after droping off the food, only post on the app that it’s been delivered once you are already in your car and about to leave, that way, costomer gets the ding that their food’s there, they open the door 5 seconds later and POOF, you’re already gone. They will be inpressed by your vanishing act and respect you having bolted off their precious property. \\n\\n\\nHope you put these to good use (except if you’re in Edmonton, cause that there town aint big enough fer the both uv us)</td>\n",

       "96   If your a noobie driver just getting started, here are a few tips that only come with time at the trade. \\n\\n1: it’s more economic to sit and wait than drive around. \\n       -since the job’s all about $/h, the act of driving means you are paying out of pocket to make the $ u recieve from working. When searching for that first delivery or on a dry spell, park in the middle of a shopping center parking lot and just wait (bring a book if u have to). At first, I was driving around restaurants and busy areas thinking I’d hedge my bets by spreading myself around, but instead just found I was using about 5$/h in gas just doing that to no actualy improvement of Dings frequencies. \\n\\n2: larger base fare aint always better.\\n     -I’ve heard and read that anything under 7$ isnt worth it. However, since tips make up roughly 50-75% of what you actually make, getting in more deliveries per hour increases tip amounts per hour. For instance, you could do about 2 deliveries of 8$ base fairs in an hour, but each one will get around 3-4$ average in tip; netting you 22-24$(not a bad hour). But, in that same hour, and with only 3$ base fair deliveries, you could do 4-5 deliveries in that hour, each with the same tip average; netting you 24-35$ (now that’s a moist hour right dhere!)\\n\\n3: darkness is better than sunshine\\n     -there’s a few advantages to delivering past the hour’s of 8 pm (if you don’t have a 7 year old’s bedtime) \\n-Restaurants after 8pm tend to have less costomers and so are more ready to prepare your delivery quicker.\\n-There are less cars on the road and so less traffic, making for quicker deliveries.\\n-Parking lots and spaces are more empty for closer and more easy parking.\\n-Many chain restaurants want you to use the drive through past 8 pm which can benefit drivers who don’t yet have a delivery bag\\n-I’ve noticed that past 8, the ratio of those sweet “leave at door” instructions appear as people are more likely in their jamyjams. This makes it that you never have to waste time at someone’s door waiting for them to slowly shuffle their way from their bathtubs to you. \\n\\n4: oh god, not the 40th floor! \\n      -by staying away from inner cities and downtowns, you reduce the chances of having to go up elevators, talking to door security guys, and having to buzz into locked buildings. I’ve done 3 minutes at the buzzer, 4 minutes going up the elevator, 2 minutes walking down those god awful halls, 2 minutes back, 4 minutes down, and then 3 minute walk to my car parked far away cause the tall ones have underground private parking and are located on unparkable roads. Downtown has the best surges fo sho, but they also come with the most hellish of deliveries! Rich suburbs near shopping centers are la Uber crème. \\n\\n-Ghost mode\\n  - just a simple one, but I’ve found that if a costomer asks for “leave at door” and you are gone before they open their door, they usually give a “thumbs up” rating more often then if they saw me or interacted with me. Why? Idk, maybe I’m friteningly ugly. And so, after droping off the food, only post on the app that it’s been delivered once you are already in your car and about to leave, that way, costomer gets the ding that their food’s there, they open the door 5 seconds later and POOF, you’re already gone. They will be inpressed by your vanishing act and respect you having bolted off their precious property. \\n\\n\\nHope you put these to good use (except if you’re in Edmonton, cause that there town aint big enough fer the both uv us)   \n",

       "96   Tips n Triks for DriversIf your a noobie driver just getting started, here are a few tips that only come with time at the trade. \\n\\n1: it’s more economic to sit and wait than drive around. \\n       -since the job’s all about $/h, the act of driving means you are paying out of pocket to make the $ u recieve from working. When searching for that first delivery or on a dry spell, park in the middle of a shopping center parking lot and just wait (bring a book if u have to). At first, I was driving around restaurants and busy areas thinking I’d hedge my bets by spreading myself around, but instead just found I was using about 5$/h in gas just doing that to no actualy improvement of Dings frequencies. \\n\\n2: larger base fare aint always better.\\n     -I’ve heard and read that anything under 7$ isnt worth it. However, since tips make up roughly 50-75% of what you actually make, getting in more deliveries per hour increases tip amounts per hour. For instance, you could do about 2 deliveries of 8$ base fairs in an hour, but each one will get around 3-4$ average in tip; netting you 22-24$(not a bad hour). But, in that same hour, and with only 3$ base fair deliveries, you could do 4-5 deliveries in that hour, each with the same tip average; netting you 24-35$ (now that’s a moist hour right dhere!)\\n\\n3: darkness is better than sunshine\\n     -there’s a few advantages to delivering past the hour’s of 8 pm (if you don’t have a 7 year old’s bedtime) \\n-Restaurants after 8pm tend to have less costomers and so are more ready to prepare your delivery quicker.\\n-There are less cars on the road and so less traffic, making for quicker deliveries.\\n-Parking lots and spaces are more empty for closer and more easy parking.\\n-Many chain restaurants want you to use the drive through past 8 pm which can benefit drivers who don’t yet have a delivery bag\\n-I’ve noticed that past 8, the ratio of those sweet “leave at door” instructions appear as people are more likely in their jamyjams. This makes it that you never have to waste time at someone’s door waiting for them to slowly shuffle their way from their bathtubs to you. \\n\\n4: oh god, not the 40th floor! \\n      -by staying away from inner cities and downtowns, you reduce the chances of having to go up elevators, talking to door security guys, and having to buzz into locked buildings. I’ve done 3 minutes at the buzzer, 4 minutes going up the elevator, 2 minutes walking down those god awful halls, 2 minutes back, 4 minutes down, and then 3 minute walk to my car parked far away cause the tall ones have underground private parking and are located on unparkable roads. Downtown has the best surges fo sho, but they also come with the most hellish of deliveries! Rich suburbs near shopping centers are la Uber crème. \\n\\n-Ghost mode\\n  - just a simple one, but I’ve found that if a costomer asks for “leave at door” and you are gone before they open their door, they usually give a “thumbs up” rating more often then if they saw me or interacted with me. Why? Idk, maybe I’m friteningly ugly. And so, after droping off the food, only post on the app that it’s been delivered once you are already in your car and about to leave, that way, costomer gets the ding that their food’s there, they open the door 5 seconds later and POOF, you’re already gone. They will be inpressed by your vanishing act and respect you having bolted off their precious property. \\n\\n\\nHope you put these to good use (except if you’re in Edmonton, cause that there town aint big enough fer the both uv us)  \n",

UE never fails to amuse me. At least I got to listen to the birds for that hour.  \n",

I am new to ubereats. I made an order yesterday for like $50 then tipped 18%. Everything went well. I then got a notification to rate the driver. So I rated him 5 stars and noticed a tip option on the bottom that said 18%. I thought nothing of it, thinking they are letting us raise or lower the original tip amount. But looking back at my receipts, it looks like I may have double tipped him? Was this the case?   \n",

I have delivered from this restaurant before in the same fashion and have never had an issue. Initially they customer service chat told me what the total payout for the delivery was. They are now telling me that the trip was unauthorized and there are no rider payments or earnings associated with it. Has anyone else had this issue and managed to get payed for it. So far I have had no luck.   \n",

I stopped after an hour because the earnings were low and I'm trying to figure out why. My total for the hour was $7.24 and one of the deliveries that I did said it was supposed to pay over $8 by itself. I only ended up getting $3 for the one that said it was going to pay over $8. Can anyone tell me why? Again, this was just a test run and it wasn't peak time, but if the app says it's going to pay \"X\" then why did I end up with \"Y\"?   \n",
       "192  I've pretty much memorized my city's map at this point, so I generally know if it's going to be a difficult drop off when I get requests (zero parking, downtown college dorms, buildings that are impossible to navigate if you're not a tenant, areas surrounded by construction or blocked off roads for events, or god forbid all of the above). I’ve been doing this for a while now, and some of these areas still take forever to complete the delivery. Do you think it would offend customers who live in those areas, or I would risk losing a tip, if I ask them to consider meeting me outside even if they requested no contact?  I would tell them its okay if they say no, but just let them know that it would make the delivery so much faster. \\nIt would be a little inconvenient on their end, but at the same time, waiting forever for your food also strikes me as inconvenient. I don't know, but let me know your thoughts. \\n\\n(Of course this does not apply to customers with circumstances that make them unable to meet outside).   \n",

I am new to ubereats. I made an order yesterday for like $50 then tipped 18%. Everything went well. I then got a notification to rate the driver. So I rated him 5 stars and noticed a tip option on the bottom that said 18%. I thought nothing of it, thinking they are letting us raise or lower the original tip amount. But looking back at my receipts, it looks like I may have double tipped him? Was this the case?  \n",

Can anyone tell me why? Again, this was just a test run and it wasn't peak time, but if the app says it's going to pay \"X\" then why did I end up with \"Y\"?  \n",
       "192  Customers with difficult drop off locationsI've pretty much memorized my city's map at this point, so I generally know if it's going to be a difficult drop off when I get requests (zero parking, downtown college dorms, buildings that are impossible to navigate if you're not a tenant, areas surrounded by construction or blocked off roads for events, or god forbid all of the above). I’ve been doing this for a while now, and some of these areas still take forever to complete the delivery. Do you think it would offend customers who live in those areas, or I would risk losing a tip, if I ask them to consider meeting me outside even if they requested no contact?  I would tell them its okay if they say no, but just let them know that it would make the delivery so much faster. \\nIt would be a little inconvenient on their end, but at the same time, waiting forever for your food also strikes me as inconvenient. I don't know, but let me know your thoughts. \\n\\n(Of course this does not apply to customers with circumstances that make them unable to meet outside).  "

They expect eats drivers to not be picky, accept low tip, and then try to hunder our work to make us pick up more deliveries. Maybe if theyd actually incentivize us rather then give us scraps we would pick up low ball orders.

       " 'Dear #UBEREATS\\nMy direct feedback response to Ubers new “no address for declines,” policy 😤 #UberEats Ok. You want to know why we don’t always accept every order that comes our way? It’s because the in restaurant wait time is not calculated. Nor are the miles driving to and from a restaurant if doing multiple drop offs. If I’m getting offered less than $2 a mile - I decline. I don’t care how much you are offering me to do a Walmart order - I always decline those. Why? Because you don’t pay us for our time. You pay us for our drop off. So no. Getting rid of the addresses upfront is outraging to me. You’re telling me I either accept the insults you send my way. Or I am stuck needing to play rusaian roulette with my own gas, time, energy, patience, and money? I’m sorry UberEats. I have been more than patience with you guys but this new update is ridiculous to me. If you genuinely want to encourage and produce a more competitive spirit to keep drivers driving for you- this is not the answer. My suggestion is as follows: just as a driver is paid for a missed drop off once the 8 min timer goes off. A driver should be paid a surge, boost, quest, or anything dollar amount, heck I’m sure coins would be enough to inspire some, after you have spent more than 8 minute waiting on your customers order. Especially on those double pick ups!',\n",

Maybe an uber AI algorithim provided you large/more orders if your acceptance rate is &gt; 85%.\\n2. How we can get more quest/promotions from uber-eats.\\n3. Is moving from blue member to gold is beneficial.\\n4. Can we get catering orders from uber-eats or do I need to work separately with restaurants owners to get catering orders.\\n5.

Also literally nobody tips maybe 1 out 10 and even when they do it doesn't equate to my minimum of 2 dollars per mile. People also are not considerate, having to deal with drunk and entitled riders. I did ended up making about 750 in two days but only because of the quest. So I will just do uber eats and not deal with all those other factors.\n",

Got to the restaurant 3 minutes late due to traffic but the food was ready and bagged so they handed it to me and I took it to the customers house. I double checked the house number, street name, Google maps, and the doordash map. All of it lined up. The app said hand it to customer so I rang the doorbell and waited. No one answered. I clicked on can't find customer and it said to try to contact them and gave me a five minute timer. I texted them and waited the five minutes. No response. Rang the doorbell one more time and waited another minute while dogs inside the house barked at me through the glass door. Underneath the timer it said that if I can't find the customer to return the order to the restaurant and had a button for return order. I clicked on return the order and the app jumped right to the dash paused screen. Confused I called support and they were a little confusing but I got the impression that the order was cancelled? The support agent asked me to unpause my dash and see if I had been paid for the order so I did and I had been.  They said to go about my business and at first I was going to continue my dash but I changed my mind and paused my dash again to go home. When I got home I got a text from the customer to leave the order at the door. This was about 25 minutes after I had initially texted. So I called dasher support again and they said the order had been abandoned but that it was documented that I had called them. I could either try returning the order to the restaurant or continue dashing but the order was done. I ended my dash and just took the order back to the restaurant. No one really had a clue what to do so they got the manager. The manager seemed confused and told me he has never had someone return the food before but thank you and that was it. I left and the restaurant had the order again. I called doordash support a third time and explained everything once again, and told them that the restaurant had accepted the food back. They documented it all, and told me that was that. \\n\\nAm I going to get deactivated?</td>\n",

       "61   I'm still relatively new but I had a confusing delivery. \\n\\nI had a delivery. Got to the restaurant 3 minutes late due to traffic but the food was ready and bagged so they handed it to me and I took it to the customers house. I double checked the house number, street name, Google maps, and the doordash map. All of it lined up. The app said hand it to customer so I rang the doorbell and waited. No one answered. I clicked on can't find customer and it said to try to contact them and gave me a five minute timer. I texted them and waited the five minutes. No response. Rang the doorbell one more time and waited another minute while dogs inside the house barked at me through the glass door. Underneath the timer it said that if I can't find the customer to return the order to the restaurant and had a button for return order. I clicked on return the order and the app jumped right to the dash paused screen. Confused I called support and they were a little confusing but I got the impression that the order was cancelled? The support agent asked me to unpause my dash and see if I had been paid for the order so I did and I had been.  They said to go about my business and at first I was going to continue my dash but I changed my mind and paused my dash again to go home. When I got home I got a text from the customer to leave the order at the door. This was about 25 minutes after I had initially texted. So I called dasher support again and they said the order had been abandoned but that it was documented that I had called them. I could either try returning the order to the restaurant or continue dashing but the order was done. I ended my dash and just took the order back to the restaurant. No one really had a clue what to do so they got the manager. The manager seemed confused and told me he has never had someone return the food before but thank you and that was it. I left and the restaurant had the order again. I called doordash support a third time and explained everything once again, and told them that the restaurant had accepted the food back. They documented it all, and told me that was that. \\n\\nAm I going to get deactivated?   \n",

I dropped off the order and like a couple minutes later I get a text saying that I dropped it to the wrong place. I told them I couldn't see the detail of their order anymore. I was sure I dropped it to the right place cause I had to walk a little further down to get to their house. They then text me asking me if need the address again so I could come back and idk it just felt off so I didn't respond. I never got a call from support or anything and so far I don't see a bad rating so I'm wondering if it was something fishy 🤔   \n",

Long story short, order said it was on the way but the driver was in the same spot for hours and eventually I just cancelled. \\n\\nI wanted to give them another chance and I was craving this type of food anyways. It appears the same thing is happening. Order was picked up like 20 minutes ago and the driver is still in the same spot (the restaurant it appears). This time I messaged the driver but no response yet. \\n\\nWhat is going on? And can I get back my tip?   \n",

       "61   Did I Fuck Up This Order?I'm still relatively new but I had a confusing delivery. \\n\\nI had a delivery. Got to the restaurant 3 minutes late due to traffic but the food was ready and bagged so they handed it to me and I took it to the customers house. I double checked the house number, street name, Google maps, and the doordash map. All of it lined up. The app said hand it to customer so I rang the doorbell and waited. No one answered. I clicked on can't find customer and it said to try to contact them and gave me a five minute timer. I texted them and waited the five minutes. No response. Rang the doorbell one more time and waited another minute while dogs inside the house barked at me through the glass door. Underneath the timer it said that if I can't find the customer to return the order to the restaurant and had a button for return order. I clicked on return the order and the app jumped right to the dash paused screen. Confused I called support and they were a little confusing but I got the impression that the order was cancelled? The support agent asked me to unpause my dash and see if I had been paid for the order so I did and I had been.  They said to go about my business and at first I was going to continue my dash but I changed my mind and paused my dash again to go home. When I got home I got a text from the customer to leave the order at the door. This was about 25 minutes after I had initially texted. So I called dasher support again and they said the order had been abandoned but that it was documented that I had called them. I could either try returning the order to the restaurant or continue dashing but the order was done. I ended my dash and just took the order back to the restaurant. No one really had a clue what to do so they got the manager. The manager seemed confused and told me he has never had someone return the food before but thank you and that was it. I left and the restaurant had the order again. I called doordash support a third time and explained everything once again, and told them that the restaurant had accepted the food back. They documented it all, and told me that was that. \\n\\nAm I going to get deactivated?  \n",

I dropped off the order and like a couple minutes later I get a text saying that I dropped it to the wrong place. I told them I couldn't see the detail of their order anymore. I was sure I dropped it to the right place cause I had to walk a little further down to get to their house. They then text me asking me if need the address again so I could come back and idk it just felt off so I didn't respond. I never got a call from support or anything and so far I don't see a bad rating so I'm wondering if it was something fishy 🤔  \n",

Long story short, order said it was on the way but the driver was in the same spot for hours and eventually I just cancelled. \\n\\nI wanted to give them another chance and I was craving this type of food anyways. It appears the same thing is happening. Order was picked up like 20 minutes ago and the driver is still in the same spot (the restaurant it appears). This time I messaged the driver but no response yet. \\n\\nWhat is going on? And can I get back my tip?  \n",

       "      <td>Hi All, \\n\\nI'm just wondering if anyone on here has experienced an unpleasant or just down right rude incident with someone making a delivery? \\n\\nI just had an incident tonight where a guy was delivering food to a unit in my condo building. You need a fob in order to get in the front door so the guy was just standing there waiting. Mind you the food was not for me, I didn't order anything but to someone else that lives in my building. Once I clicked the door open he pushed through me. The door is barely fucking open, I am trying to get out and he is trying to come in at the same time. Pushed me against the door frame (so I was fucking stuck) and stepped on my dog so he could get in. No apologies, nothing. Didn't give a fuck. I yelled at him asking him WTF is his problem and all he said was \"It was an accident\" then went in the elevator and disappeared.\\n\\nI called Uber Eats, spent 30 minutes on the phone with them just for them to ask me repeatedly what happened and tell me they'll forward the incident to another team. I asked them to find the guy by what deliveries have been made to my building address around 11:15pm tonight and they said they don't know if they can do that??? I find that to be a load of shit.\\n\\nBasically I wanted to know if anyone here has had a bad experience with an Uber eats delivery person and if you made a complaint. If so, what came of it? Do you think they'd even really do anything?\\n\\nOr maybe you work for them and had someone make a complaint, does Uber as a company, actually do anything?</td>\n",

Great. \\n\\nExcept this week, the app has been constantly crashing on me, I show up to deliveries that are already picked up, or I’m told insane wait times by restaurants. \\n\\nI accepted a delivery about 20 minutes ago, and when I showed up to the restaurant they told me their system was being bad tonight and the order wouldn’t be ready for another 90 minutes. Obviously, I canceled for excessive wait time. Then uber offered me this exact delivery four more times in a row. \\n\\nI went into rest mode and called support, and they told me they don’t know if that affected my eligibility but “we don’t recommend canceling deliveries”. Great. \\n\\nSo far this week, I have seen some reimbursement for their promotion, which surprised me, but I’m not betting on it tonight.   \n",

I had only been doing uber eats and some Grubhub for about 9 months. I still decided to do it but so many things make it not worth it at all. The offers that come in only say the distance to pick up and minutes, how can I make a viable decision with only that information. Most of the trips I did were between 10-15 miles. Also literally nobody tips maybe 1 out 10 and even when they do it doesn't equate to my minimum of 2 dollars per mile. People also are not considerate, having to deal with drunk and entitled riders. I did ended up making about 750 in two days but only because of the quest. So I will just do uber eats and not deal with all those other factors.   \n",

Simply cancelled the order and started my next one at a Whataburger. I sat there for thirty minutes before asking them how much longer they would take to which they said they hadn’t even begun working on it. I just cancelled the order and walked out.   \n",

Get there and the line stretches all the way around. After 5 minutes and the line doesn't move an inch I cancel. As Im driving past the many cars I noticed the first car is at the order screen....and it's not powered on. I wish I took a picture but I was too busy screaming at this idiot. On what level of stupidity must you be at not to notice that the place is closed? I can forgive everyone behind the lead car because you couldn't noticed it unless you were the first 2 or 3 cars. I just know that in a week the top local news story will be 12 carloads of people starve to death in Wendy's drive thru line.   \n",

I got paid no extra &amp; on the pay window it says total trip time 21 minutes??? They won’t reply to me about it I feel like I’m screwed over. If I had of canceled they would’ve paid the next driver a little extra so why not me for sitting and wasting 35 min.  Ended up making $14 in the whole hour   \n",

       "8   Does Uber Eats actually do anything when there are complaints about delivery drivers?Hi All, \\n\\nI'm just wondering if anyone on here has experienced an unpleasant or just down right rude incident with someone making a delivery? \\n\\nI just had an incident tonight where a guy was delivering food to a unit in my condo building. You need a fob in order to get in the front door so the guy was just standing there waiting. Mind you the food was not for me, I didn't order anything but to someone else that lives in my building. Once I clicked the door open he pushed through me. The door is barely fucking open, I am trying to get out and he is trying to come in at the same time. Pushed me against the door frame (so I was fucking stuck) and stepped on my dog so he could get in. No apologies, nothing. Didn't give a fuck. I yelled at him asking him WTF is his problem and all he said was \"It was an accident\" then went in the elevator and disappeared.\\n\\nI called Uber Eats, spent 30 minutes on the phone with them just for them to ask me repeatedly what happened and tell me they'll forward the incident to another team. I asked them to find the guy by what deliveries have been made to my building address around 11:15pm tonight and they said they don't know if they can do that??? I find that to be a load of shit.\\n\\nBasically I wanted to know if anyone here has had a bad experience with an Uber eats delivery person and if you made a complaint. If so, what came of it? Do you think they'd even really do anything?\\n\\nOr maybe you work for them and had someone make a complaint, does Uber as a company, actually do anything?  \n",

Great. \\n\\nExcept this week, the app has been constantly crashing on me, I show up to deliveries that are already picked up, or I’m told insane wait times by restaurants. \\n\\nI accepted a delivery about 20 minutes ago, and when I showed up to the restaurant they told me their system was being bad tonight and the order wouldn’t be ready for another 90 minutes. Obviously, I canceled for excessive wait time. Then uber offered me this exact delivery four more times in a row. \\n\\nI went into rest mode and called support, and they told me they don’t know if that affected my eligibility but “we don’t recommend canceling deliveries”. Great. \\n\\nSo far this week, I have seen some reimbursement for their promotion, which surprised me, but I’m not betting on it tonight.  \n",

I had only been doing uber eats and some Grubhub for about 9 months. I still decided to do it but so many things make it not worth it at all. The offers that come in only say the distance to pick up and minutes, how can I make a viable decision with only that information. Most of the trips I did were between 10-15 miles. Also literally nobody tips maybe 1 out 10 and even when they do it doesn't equate to my minimum of 2 dollars per mile. People also are not considerate, having to deal with drunk and entitled riders. I did ended up making about 750 in two days but only because of the quest. So I will just do uber eats and not deal with all those other factors.  \n",

Get there and the line stretches all the way around. After 5 minutes and the line doesn't move an inch I cancel. As Im driving past the many cars I noticed the first car is at the order screen....and it's not powered on. I wish I took a picture but I was too busy screaming at this idiot. On what level of stupidity must you be at not to notice that the place is closed? I can forgive everyone behind the lead car because you couldn't noticed it unless you were the first 2 or 3 cars. I just know that in a week the top local news story will be 12 carloads of people starve to death in Wendy's drive thru line.  \n",

I got paid no extra &amp; on the pay window it says total trip time 21 minutes??? They won’t reply to me about it I feel like I’m screwed over. If I had of canceled they would’ve paid the next driver a little extra so why not me for sitting and wasting 35 min.  Ended up making $14 in the whole hour  "

After working 4 hours and getting 1 order due there being 20 riders or more in 1 small area i'm wondering what your take on this is\\n\\nI personally think they don't have to pay employees min wage. Although it'd be amazing because I'd literally just wake up at 6am and work until 2pm I think they should atleast up the pay per delivery since \"boosts\" are essentially a scam. \"boosts arent a scam\", well after the \"fees\" they take from each order if you have a 1.2x it's basically the same as if there was no boost\\n\\nif this barely made snese it's 4am and even though this is part time for me it is annoying how the business model works. I actually don't mind delivering food and it being busy comes down to the culuture of the country or area but sometimes it seems stupid and they know they can do it because they know most of the people working for them in this country arent going to protest or do anything. When 2 people say \"sometimes its like slave labour\" that's when you know they could be doing things differently. This is for me to gain perspective, if I wanted to rant about how inefficent the app is, how they also fuck the customer and how the website is I could write a 50,000 word essay with multiple solutions</td>\n",

I wasn't delivering. My car was totalled but the guy I hit barely had a scratch. Insurance says I'm at fault but I'm in a no fault state. No citation was given. Am I good or...? I'm just worried about the background checks. I deliver for doordash as well.   \n",

       "96   If your a noobie driver just getting started, here are a few tips that only come with time at the trade. \\n\\n1: it’s more economic to sit and wait than drive around. \\n       -since the job’s all about $/h, the act of driving means you are paying out of pocket to make the $ u recieve from working. When searching for that first delivery or on a dry spell, park in the middle of a shopping center parking lot and just wait (bring a book if u have to). At first, I was driving around restaurants and busy areas thinking I’d hedge my bets by spreading myself around, but instead just found I was using about 5$/h in gas just doing that to no actualy improvement of Dings frequencies. \\n\\n2: larger base fare aint always better.\\n     -I’ve heard and read that anything under 7$ isnt worth it. However, since tips make up roughly 50-75% of what you actually make, getting in more deliveries per hour increases tip amounts per hour. For instance, you could do about 2 deliveries of 8$ base fairs in an hour, but each one will get around 3-4$ average in tip; netting you 22-24$(not a bad hour). But, in that same hour, and with only 3$ base fair deliveries, you could do 4-5 deliveries in that hour, each with the same tip average; netting you 24-35$ (now that’s a moist hour right dhere!)\\n\\n3: darkness is better than sunshine\\n     -there’s a few advantages to delivering past the hour’s of 8 pm (if you don’t have a 7 year old’s bedtime) \\n-Restaurants after 8pm tend to have less costomers and so are more ready to prepare your delivery quicker.\\n-There are less cars on the road and so less traffic, making for quicker deliveries.\\n-Parking lots and spaces are more empty for closer and more easy parking.\\n-Many chain restaurants want you to use the drive through past 8 pm which can benefit drivers who don’t yet have a delivery bag\\n-I’ve noticed that past 8, the ratio of those sweet “leave at door” instructions appear as people are more likely in their jamyjams. This makes it that you never have to waste time at someone’s door waiting for them to slowly shuffle their way from their bathtubs to you. \\n\\n4: oh god, not the 40th floor! \\n      -by staying away from inner cities and downtowns, you reduce the chances of having to go up elevators, talking to door security guys, and having to buzz into locked buildings. I’ve done 3 minutes at the buzzer, 4 minutes going up the elevator, 2 minutes walking down those god awful halls, 2 minutes back, 4 minutes down, and then 3 minute walk to my car parked far away cause the tall ones have underground private parking and are located on unparkable roads. Downtown has the best surges fo sho, but they also come with the most hellish of deliveries! Rich suburbs near shopping centers are la Uber crème. \\n\\n-Ghost mode\\n  - just a simple one, but I’ve found that if a costomer asks for “leave at door” and you are gone before they open their door, they usually give a “thumbs up” rating more often then if they saw me or interacted with me. Why? Idk, maybe I’m friteningly ugly. And so, after droping off the food, only post on the app that it’s been delivered once you are already in your car and about to leave, that way, costomer gets the ding that their food’s there, they open the door 5 seconds later and POOF, you’re already gone. They will be inpressed by your vanishing act and respect you having bolted off their precious property. \\n\\n\\nHope you put these to good use (except if you’re in Edmonton, cause that there town aint big enough fer the both uv us)   \n",

I have 2 jobs that pay above min wage so I'm good, but I do uber part time when I buy things and would rather it not come out of my other source of income. After working 4 hours and getting 1 order due there being 20 riders or more in 1 small area i'm wondering what your take on this is\\n\\nI personally think they don't have to pay employees min wage. Although it'd be amazing because I'd literally just wake up at 6am and work until 2pm I think they should atleast up the pay per delivery since \"boosts\" are essentially a scam. \"boosts arent a scam\", well after the \"fees\" they take from each order if you have a 1.2x it's basically the same as if there was no boost\\n\\nif this barely made snese it's 4am and even though this is part time for me it is annoying how the business model works. I actually don't mind delivering food and it being busy comes down to the culuture of the country or area but sometimes it seems stupid and they know they can do it because they know most of the people working for them in this country arent going to protest or do anything. When 2 people say \"sometimes its like slave labour\" that's when you know they could be doing things differently. This is for me to gain perspective, if I wanted to rant about how inefficent the app is, how they also fuck the customer and how the website is I could write a 50,000 word essay with multiple solutions   \n",

I wasn't delivering. My car was totalled but the guy I hit barely had a scratch. Insurance says I'm at fault but I'm in a no fault state. No citation was given. Am I good or...? I'm just worried about the background checks. I deliver for doordash as well.  \n",

I know it’s $50 but I haven’t found a good alternative   \n",

It’s stupid, I’m already paying fees and my $10 meal just turned into a $22 meal why would I turn that into $25? Tipping is not necessary and I’ve always received good service without tipping. It’s just a scam.   \n",

       "96   Tips n Triks for DriversIf your a noobie driver just getting started, here are a few tips that only come with time at the trade. \\n\\n1: it’s more economic to sit and wait than drive around. \\n       -since the job’s all about $/h, the act of driving means you are paying out of pocket to make the $ u recieve from working. When searching for that first delivery or on a dry spell, park in the middle of a shopping center parking lot and just wait (bring a book if u have to). At first, I was driving around restaurants and busy areas thinking I’d hedge my bets by spreading myself around, but instead just found I was using about 5$/h in gas just doing that to no actualy improvement of Dings frequencies. \\n\\n2: larger base fare aint always better.\\n     -I’ve heard and read that anything under 7$ isnt worth it. However, since tips make up roughly 50-75% of what you actually make, getting in more deliveries per hour increases tip amounts per hour. For instance, you could do about 2 deliveries of 8$ base fairs in an hour, but each one will get around 3-4$ average in tip; netting you 22-24$(not a bad hour). But, in that same hour, and with only 3$ base fair deliveries, you could do 4-5 deliveries in that hour, each with the same tip average; netting you 24-35$ (now that’s a moist hour right dhere!)\\n\\n3: darkness is better than sunshine\\n     -there’s a few advantages to delivering past the hour’s of 8 pm (if you don’t have a 7 year old’s bedtime) \\n-Restaurants after 8pm tend to have less costomers and so are more ready to prepare your delivery quicker.\\n-There are less cars on the road and so less traffic, making for quicker deliveries.\\n-Parking lots and spaces are more empty for closer and more easy parking.\\n-Many chain restaurants want you to use the drive through past 8 pm which can benefit drivers who don’t yet have a delivery bag\\n-I’ve noticed that past 8, the ratio of those sweet “leave at door” instructions appear as people are more likely in their jamyjams. This makes it that you never have to waste time at someone’s door waiting for them to slowly shuffle their way from their bathtubs to you. \\n\\n4: oh god, not the 40th floor! \\n      -by staying away from inner cities and downtowns, you reduce the chances of having to go up elevators, talking to door security guys, and having to buzz into locked buildings. I’ve done 3 minutes at the buzzer, 4 minutes going up the elevator, 2 minutes walking down those god awful halls, 2 minutes back, 4 minutes down, and then 3 minute walk to my car parked far away cause the tall ones have underground private parking and are located on unparkable roads. Downtown has the best surges fo sho, but they also come with the most hellish of deliveries! Rich suburbs near shopping centers are la Uber crème. \\n\\n-Ghost mode\\n  - just a simple one, but I’ve found that if a costomer asks for “leave at door” and you are gone before they open their door, they usually give a “thumbs up” rating more often then if they saw me or interacted with me. Why? Idk, maybe I’m friteningly ugly. And so, after droping off the food, only post on the app that it’s been delivered once you are already in your car and about to leave, that way, costomer gets the ding that their food’s there, they open the door 5 seconds later and POOF, you’re already gone. They will be inpressed by your vanishing act and respect you having bolted off their precious property. \\n\\n\\nHope you put these to good use (except if you’re in Edmonton, cause that there town aint big enough fer the both uv us)  \n",

I have 2 jobs that pay above min wage so I'm good, but I do uber part time when I buy things and would rather it not come out of my other source of income. After working 4 hours and getting 1 order due there being 20 riders or more in 1 small area i'm wondering what your take on this is\\n\\nI personally think they don't have to pay employees min wage. Although it'd be amazing because I'd literally just wake up at 6am and work until 2pm I think they should atleast up the pay per delivery since \"boosts\" are essentially a scam. \"boosts arent a scam\", well after the \"fees\" they take from each order if you have a 1.2x it's basically the same as if there was no boost\\n\\nif this barely made snese it's 4am and even though this is part time for me it is annoying how the business model works. I actually don't mind delivering food and it being busy comes down to the culuture of the country or area but sometimes it seems stupid and they know they can do it because they know most of the people working for them in this country arent going to protest or do anything. When 2 people say \"sometimes its like slave labour\" that's when you know they could be doing things differently. This is for me to gain perspective, if I wanted to rant about how inefficent the app is, how they also fuck the customer and how the website is I could write a 50,000 word essay with multiple solutions  \n",
